        <p>lotI’ve made it no secret; over the years, I’ve become obsessed with polar travel.

In fact, I’ve become so obsessed that I am now an expedition guide, spending roughly half the year at sea in Antarctica and the Arctic. And I’m not slowing down anytime soon. I’ve already started a three-month season with Adventure Canada in the Arctic for this summer in Canada and Greenland.

These polar places are almost inaccessible. The easiest and most efficient way to visit is by expedition ship. Most of the year, sea ice locks the Arctic away. Only for a few months in the summer does it melt enough to allow access. Most people get around by small planes, boats, or snowmobiles (in winter). Personally, I find this isolation fascinating.

Here, whales swim by us all the time, polar bears peek out from behind the sea ice, and colorful communities give us the most incredible welcomes. The Arctic is vast, wild, and unpredictable. It gets under your skin.</p>

        <p>There aren’t many places in New Zealand that make me question my choice to live in Wānaka, but Golden Bay definitely did. Warm, sunny, and most importantly, cheap, Golden Bay piqued my interest as somewhere I could easily live comfortably. I’m just not sure I’m hippie enough to fit the local criteria, but more on that in a minute. 

After finishing the Heaphy Track outside of Takaka, I caught the shuttle from Golden Bay Air to the airport, where I rented a car. These are the guys who organize the logistics and flights around the area. Takaka is approximately one million miles and $500 worth of petrol away from Wānaka, so when I heard you could rent a car there, I thought it would be a good chance to finally explore an area of New Zealand I rarely visit. 

I’ll preface this by saying that the term “airport” is a stretch; it’s an office with a little runway, which I can’t remember if it was paved or not. These are small plane flights. It’s so chill and easy, exactly what you want on a holiday. The car was an old Honda that felt like you could take it anywhere. I rolled the windows down and hit the road to Takaka, the salty, warm air reminding me I was in paradise. It’s a place where you know that everyone knows each other’s names. And all of their business, too. Love it!.</p>
